We have transformed the target using smooting technique and analyzed the trend in the sales across weeks. Computed the **Temporary price reduction**(TPR):- 
TPR is a price decrease of greater than 5% of the regular price. The regular price is the median of all prices within 5% of the maximum price in the previous seven weeks.
ARIMA model was used for the purpose of forecasting.
